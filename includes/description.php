<h2 style="text-transform: capitalize"><span>Do Not Track</span></h2>
<p>Mozilla is a global, nonprofit organization dedicated to making the Web better. We emphasize principle over profit, and believe that the Web is a shared public resource to be cared for, not a commodity to be sold. We answer to no one but you and believe it is crucial to put you in control of your online experience. We are aiming to give you better insight and control into the ways your personal information is collected, used, stored and shared online. </p>

<p>Mozilla Firefox offers a Do Not Track feature that lets you express a preference not to be tracked by websites. When the feature is enabled, Firefox will tell advertising networks and other websites and applications that you want to opt-out
of tracking for purposes like behavioral advertising.</p>
